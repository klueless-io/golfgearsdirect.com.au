<p><b><span style="font-weight: 400;">By David Cruwys</span></b></p> <p> </p> <p><a href="https://golfgearsdirect.com.au/">Golf</a> is a unique blend of physical exertion, social interaction, and a therapeutic series of motions. It’s basically an exercise, a social activity, and a way to de-stress in one.</p> <p>It's also incredibly fun!</p> <p>This might not be obvious to those who have never played golf before, but it really can be one of the most enjoyable activities out there. Not just for avid golfers but for everyone.</p> <p>All you need to do is keep 7 simple things in mind.</p> <br> <p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MVuOwzFGaj8" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p> </p> <br style="font-weight: 400;"> <h1><b>Enjoying Golf, It’s Not That Hard!</b></h1> <iframe src="https://www.instagram.com/p/BenB6-HAAlA/embed" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="auto" allowtransparency="false" frameborder="0" onload=""> </iframe> <p>When you’re just starting out with golf, you don’t need to emulate what you see on TV or get caught up in all the rules, right away.</p> <p>If you get bent out of shape over the simplest things like trying to learn all the <a href="https://golfgearsdirect.com.au/collections/electric-golf">golf equipment names</a>, you’re only going to get frustrated.</p> <p>The same goes for when you’ve been playing golf for a long time.</p> <p>If you put too much emphasis on the rules, you’re missing out on a whole other side to the sport, especially since a lot of the rules in golf only really need to apply to competitions.</p> <p>In reality, all you need to focus on to truly enjoy golf from start to finish are a few key aspects, namely the following:</p> <ul> <li>Having the right equipment</li> <li>Knowing how to swing the clubs</li> <li>Being aware of the rules of the course</li> </ul> <p>Other than those three factors, everything is fair game. Of course, they might need some explaining, so let’s get right on that.</p> <h2>Equipment Matters</h2> <p>The <a href="https://golfgearsdirect.com.au/collections/all">golf equipment</a> you use (your club, gloves, balls, bag, caddy, etc.) will have a profound effect on how much you enjoy the game. This is just fact.</p> <p>Any good golfer will tell you that a horrible set of equipment can lead to a terrible first impression, which can then set the tone for the rest of the session.</p> <p>If you really want to make the most out of your time on the course, you’ll have to choose your gear accordingly. Your first set doesn’t need to be the stupidly expensive kind, either, since there are plenty of reasonably priced club sets available.</p> <p>This is why it’s always best to ask the question “<a href="http://golftips.golfweek.com/equipment-need-golfing-1414.html">what equipment do you need to play golf</a>?” before starting out.</p> <p>Naturally, the question you need to ask after that is how you can best use your equipment, and that's what we'll be discussing next.</p> <h2>Just Know How To Swing</h2> <p>A huge part of golf is swinging your clubs.</p> <p>It’s what you’ll be doing most the time in any given game, next only to walking across the grass after you send the ball flying.</p> <p>That’s why it’s so important to get your swing down before doing anything else. Once you master the motion and familiarize yourself with the physics that go into this particular aspect of the game, you’ll find it much more enjoyable.</p> <p>Consequently, if you don’t know how to swing your club, here’s what happens:</p> <ul> <li>You waste your energy</li> <li>The ball won’t go very far</li> <li>The angle gets messed up</li> <li>You wrap the club around a tree and walk away while yelling about how golf is stupid (presumably)</li> </ul> <p>There are plenty of <a href="https://golfdigestplanner.com/how-to-choose-the-right-golf-course-for-your-event/">golf courses</a> that offer basic training to new members or even just walk-in golfers. Take advantage of that.</p> <p>Alternatively, you could also ask for help from someone you know who already practices golf.</p> <p>Once you’ve got the stance, distance, alignment, grip, and backswing right and know the answer to <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/golf-tee-term-1564164">what does a golf ball sit on</a>, the whole course is your oyster.</p> <p>Only then can you down the path of being a student of the green.</p> <h2>Course Rules Matter, A Lot</h2> <p>Course rules are not the same as golf rules.</p> <p>The former is a set of guidelines that you want to adhere to if you prefer to avoid getting kicked out. The latter is just a series of squiggles that you don’t need to bother with if you’re just starting out or playing casually.</p> <p>Always remember that there could be other golfers in the area. The club or course rules exist so that you and the rest of the other players can maximize your enjoyment without getting in each other’s way.</p> <p>Now, a discussion about how to enjoy golf really isn’t complete without also talking about the stuff that can gum up your experience. As such, it’s worth talking about the things that can ruin a perfectly good golfing session.</p> <h1>Golf Equipment, The Good, The Thing You Shouldn't Get</h1> <p>Golf is a sport that heavily relies on gear. You could try hitting the ball with your foot, but there’s already a sport like that; it’s called football.</p> <p>For maximum enjoyment in golf, you need to have the right equipment to serve your needs.</p> <p>Now, on the likely chance that you actually want to get the best equipment for you right away, here are a few tips to consider:</p> <ul> <li>Consider your skill level</li> <li>Play it safe</li> <li>Don’t shirk convenience</li> <li>Go the modern route</li> </ul> <p>It’s worth pointing out that choosing your golf gear is never cut and dry. These tips can only function as templates that you could customize according to your particular situation.</p> <h2>Beginner, Intermediate, Yeah Right</h2> <p>Here’s the thing: just as there are incredibly talented professional basketball players, so are there incredibly skilled golfers.</p> <p>Here’s another thing: you don’t have to get to that level to enjoy the game.</p> <p>With that in mind, it’s always best to consider your skill level when shopping for equipment. For beginners, this means keeping your gear simple.</p> <p>Don’t buy the most expensive bags, trolleys, <a href="https://www.globalgolf.com/golf-clubs/buying-guide/">golf clubs</a>, and balls from the get-go. You’re going to be using those tools a lot and you will wear them out fast.</p> <p>Constantly replacing pricey gear is not fun.</p> <p>As your skills develop, your equipment will take less of a beating and you’ll know how to care for them. That’s when you can loosen up a bit and splurge.</p> <h2>3 Woods, 8 Irons</h2> <p>The safest set of clubs for beginners is 3 Woods and 8 Iron. You don’t have to stick to just those suggested clubs, but we highly recommend that you do. Having more clubs can actually increase the complexity of the game, instead of simplifying it.</p> <p>That could then make it less fun.</p> <p>Intermediate players and pros might know how to choose clubs that offer minute differences in results. Beginners will not and forcing the issue can lead to frustration.</p> <h2>If It’s Convenient, Use It</h2> <p>Golf involves a lot of walking around, so if you can get something to make things easier for yourself, do it. There are remote-controlled caddies out there that take your bag to you. If you don’t mind putting in at least a little effort, there are also trolleys that can push and pull without too much trouble.</p> <p>Remember that not everyone can have a human caddy. This goes double for new golfers.</p> <h2>Modernize, It’s Fine</h2> <p>Golf might be an old sport, but this doesn’t mean you can’t consider technology when buying your equipment. There are electric caddies all around to take the manual labor out of the equation when golfing.</p> <p>There are also modern clubs that take advantage of advancements in material engineering to make better heads.</p> <p>Other players have been using technology to make golf more enjoyable for decades. The spread of golf cart use is proof of that.</p> <p>They just add that extra layer of fun to the activity.</p> <p>Speaking of which, if you’re interested in injecting some whimsy into golf to make it more engaging, you can actually do that. Even veteran players need a change of pace when things start to get stale, which the next section can address.</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="/img/news/11-essential-golf-details-to-remember-and-4-ways-to-make-it-more-fun-1.png" alt="Golf Balls"></span></p> <h1>In Conclusion</h1> <p>Playing golf is fun, comes with a whole host of benefits, and doesn’t need to be the complicated activity that a lot of people view it as. Now that you know what you can do to make golf more enjoyable, you have the chance to experience the sport in an entirely different way.</p> <p>Just keep experimenting. It’s worth it.</p>
