The total score is based upon strokes and handicaps, and equated to the other players to distinguish the winner. According to Brent Kelley “The simplest way to mark the scorecard is very simple indeed: When playing stroke play, count the number of strokes you've taken on the hole just completed, and write that number down in the box corresponding to that hole on the scorecard. At the end of each nine holes, tally up the strokes for your front nine and back nine totals, respectively, then add up those two numbers for your 18-hole score.”<br><br><br></p> <h3> <span style="color: #660000;"><strong>First Aid Kit</strong></span> </h3> <p>Emergencies from the golf course cannot be ignored. Nothing is worse than a great game ruined by a sudden headache or back pain, or the occasional blister. Try to pack a small first-aid kit in your golf bag. Make sure there are pain relievers, bandages, gauze and disinfectants.<br><br><br></p> <h3><span style="color: #660000;"><strong>Extra Golf Tee</strong></span></h3> <p>A tee is a <strong>stand used to support a still golf ball </strong>so that the player can strike it. It is a small piece of equipment that raises the golf ball off the ground when playing the first stroke of a hole from the teeing ground. Typically a thin, wood or plastic peg, two or three inches in height, over which a golf ball sits in a steady and motionless place. The tee is placed down into the grass on the teeing ground, leaving a portion of the tee above ground, and the ball placed atop the golf tee prior to playing the stroke.<br><br><br></p> <h3><span style="color: #660000;"><strong>Golf Bag Cooler</strong></span></h3> <p>A golf bag with cooler is ideal for people who are spending a lot of time on the course. Many include reusable ice packs that can stay cold, and keep their beverage of choice cold, during the entire day of golfing. Some are also changeable so that they can be used as a <strong>club car cooler</strong>, which may not be one size fits all. One thing that people question about golf coolers is their size and if it’s too bulky to carry around.<br><br><br></p> <h3><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>Golf Ball Retriever</strong> </span></h3> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/golf-accessories-9.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">it is used by golfers in order to retrieve lost or misdirected balls. They allow one to retrieve balls from water hazards, deep rough or even the occasional sand trap, where they would not be able to reach them.Some retrievers use telescopic extensions up to 4.5 meters, enabling balls to be lifted from water using the swiveling cup at the end. This type of equipment is helpful particularly if playing on golf courses where water hazards are dominant.<br><br><br></p> <h3> <span style="color: #660000;"><strong>Business Cards</strong></span> </h3> <p style="float: left;">Last but definitely not the least business cards. It’s no secret that the golf course is a great place to link and meet new golf buddies, maybe even possible business partnerships or job opportunities.<br><br><a href="https://golfgearsdirect.com.au/"><img alt="" src="/img/news/golf-accessories-10.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></a>You should always have a few business cards in your golf bag, as you never know who you might meet out there.<br><br>When playing golf, relaxation, trajectory, and balance are important factors to consider.
