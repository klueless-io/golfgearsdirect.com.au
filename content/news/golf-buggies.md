But, it'll be a<strong> lot easier to focus on your game</strong> if your back isn't aching from hauling a heavy bag around. Plus, your golf cart allows you to express yourself in a way that's rare in sports.<br><br><br></p> <h2><strong>There are two main types of golf carts</strong></h2> <h3><span style="color: #990000;"><strong>Gasoline Golf Carts:</strong></span></h3> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/golf-buggies-2.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">Gasoline Golf Carts work just like little cars. A small engine, running on gasoline, powers the cart's wheels. However, <strong>one major difference</strong> between a typical car and a gasoline-powered golf cart is <strong>when the engine runs</strong>. In a car, the engine starts when you turn the key, and it keeps running until you switch the ignition off.<br><br>In a gasoline-powered golf cart, the engine starts when you step on the gas pedal, and it shuts off when you take your foot off the gas. That feature helps save gas, cuts down on emissions and helps keep the course quiet, too. And it's nice that you won't have to be thinking about your next shot over the drone of an engine.<br><br><br></p> <h3> <strong>Gas Benefits</strong> </h3> <p><strong>Some golf cart owners prefer gas-powered golf carts</strong> because they<strong> run at faster speeds</strong>, can<strong> pull heavier loads</strong> and are easy to refill. More speed means making it from one place to the next in less time.</p> <p>As well, faster carts are <strong>sometimes allowed to drive on roads where slow-moving electric carts are not able to maintain minimum speeds</strong>. Given their benefits, gas carts are <strong>often popular</strong> among those who prefer a custom-built cart. These sorts of carts feature more amenities and options, which drives up the price of the carts. <br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Gas Drawbacks </strong></h3> <p>With gas-powered carts, a driver only needs to dump a gallon of fuel into a cart to resume operation, <strong>but the fuel also produces more pollution</strong>. The carbon-monoxide emissions pose a threat to health when carts are operated within enclosed spaces such as a garage. As well, gas carts make more noise and require regular maintenance in the form of oil changes. <br><br><br></p> <h3> <span style="color: #990000;"><strong>Electric Golf Carts:</strong></span> </h3> <p style="float: right;"><a href="https://golfgearsdirect.com.au/"><img alt="" src="/img/news/golf-buggies-3.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></a><strong>Uses batteries to power an electric motor.</strong> The batteries are typically charged by plugging the cart into a wall outlet, just like the ones you have in your house. However, some golf carts are now being fitted with solar panels on their roofs to help charge the batteries.<br><br>Most golf carts that are used exclusively for golf play are relatively plain. They're just basic two seaters. However, you can also get modified golf carts that can carry more than two people and move supplies, like food or luggage, from place to place.<br><br>Gasoline golf carts can also be fitted with more powerful motors, beefed-up suspensions and four-wheel drive, making them ideal for work in rugged areas. Plus, you can also get golf carts that have been modified to look like a Porsche, a Hummer or even a Bentley.

Thus, they are <strong>friendlier to the environment</strong>. They also <strong>produce less noise than gas carts</strong>. Most electric golf carts cost slightly less to purchase and they are less frequently used for custom-built carts.</p> <p>Used electric carts are generally less costly to purchase than their gas-powered counterparts and they are more readily available. As well, electric golf carts cost less to maintain and operate because recharging them is less expensive than buying gas for a gas cart and because they do not require as much constant maintenance.<br><br><br></p> <h3> <strong>Electric Drawbacks</strong> </h3> Electric golf carts pose problems because it can be more difficult to estimate when they will run out of power and they are more difficult to recharge.<br> <ul></ul> <p>If a cart runs out of battery power on the golf course or in another location away from a charging unit, drivers can be stranded; in addition, electric carts feature batteries that are not easily removed for charging. In many cases, they need to be towed or pushed when they run out of power. <br><br><br></p> <h2><strong>How Do They Work?</strong></h2> <h3><strong><a href="https://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/sports/golf/basics/golf-carts3.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gas-powered Golf Carts</a></strong></h3> <p>Gas powered golf carts <span style="font-size: 15px;">run on combustion engines. These engines are usually four-stroke, but older models might use two-stroke instead. They're fueled with regular gas like any car or truck.<br><br><br></span></p> <ul></ul> <h3><strong>Electric Golf Carts</strong></h3> <p>Electric gold carts run on battery cells. Most of them are 36-volt or 48-volt. The batteries need to be regularly recharged to keep the cart going. <br><br><br></p> <h2><strong>Purchasing Tips:</strong></h2> <p style="float: right;"><a href="https://www.rmigolfcarts.com/blogs/news/7414094-which-should-you-choose-gas-vs-electric" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="/img/news/golf-buggies-4.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></a>If you plan on buying a golf buggy for yourself, you have to first consider its features. Think of how many passengers you are going to take along. There are models which can seat as many as 6 people but more common are the 2 seaters or the 4 seaters.

Of course, if you're adding power to the cart's engine, you'll also want to upgrade the brakes and maybe even add safety features like seat belts.<br><br><br></p> <h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Quickly Reminders!! </strong></h3> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/golf-buggies-11.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>Gas-powered golf carts are strong, steady operators.
