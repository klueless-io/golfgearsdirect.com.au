<p> Golf equipment encompasses the various items that are used to play the sport of golf. Types of equipment include the <strong>golf ball</strong> itself, implements designed for striking the golf ball, devices that aid in the process of playing a stroke, and items that in some way enrich the playing experience. </p> <p> </p> <h2><span style="color: #38761d;"><strong>Equipment:</strong></span></h2> <h3></h3> <h3><strong>Golf Ball</strong></h3> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/golf-equipment-1.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">The ball forms the heart of the game of golf. <a href="https://amzn.to/2vOVH1d" title="Bridgestone Golf Balls " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Golf balls</strong></a> are dimpled and small in size. In accordance to the rules of golf, the ball must weigh no more than 1.620 oz and it should measure up to a diameter not less than 1.680 in. Dimples in golf balls were introduced in the early 1900s; with these dimple-spotted balls, the golfers can strike it to reach a farther distance and can also gain more control of the ball’s flight, spin and trajectory.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Ball Markers: </strong></h3> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/golf-equipment-2.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">A <strong>device is provided for marking the position of a golf ball</strong> on a putting green while the ball has been temporarily removed from play to allow another golfer to putt towards the cup. The <a href="https://amzn.to/2nGA66P" title="MagiDeal 5 Pieces Stainless Steel Funny Golf Ball Marker With Magnetic Hat Clip Golfer Gifts Golf Accessories " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>marker</strong></a> is in the form of a flat disc formed with a central integral peg extending from one face thereof and a layer of non-woven fibers bonded to the opposite face thereof.<br><br>The peg is pressed into the ground to temporarily anchor the device in position with the fiber covered face exposed. The fibers form a soft mat similar in texture to the surrounding grass so that the direction of a putted ball will not be materially altered should the ball roll over the device.<br><br>A pad faced with resilient hooks is provided for temporary locking connection with the fibers of the locking device. The pad is provided with a layer of pressure sensitive material which will allow the pad to be mounted conveniently on an article of clothing such as the visor of a cap or the like.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Golf Clubs:</strong></h3> <p>The golf club, <strong>also called the golf driver</strong>, is the <strong>cane like golf equipment</strong> with which the golfer strikes the ball.

There are different kinds of golf clubs that prove to be contextually advantageous than the other, based on the landscapes. To make a perfect dive, you have to use the proper golf club, considering the terrain of the landscape – be it grassy, sandy or concrete.</p> <p> </p> <h2><strong>There are three basic types of golf clubs commonly known as wood, iron and putter.</strong></h2> <h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Woods</strong></h3> <ol></ol> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/golf-equipment-3.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>Woods are big headed clubs that are often made of wood and <strong>used for long-range shots</strong>. They have long shafts that emphasize on speed and distance coverage and less on precision. Golfers use woods <strong>when they intend to cover a long distance with their shot</strong>, or when they find themselves sweating it out in the fairway.<br><br></p> <h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Iron</strong></h3> <ol></ol> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/golf-equipment-4.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>Irons are <strong>flat headed clubs</strong> that are made of metal and <strong>used for a wide variety of shots</strong> in the game. This driver is crafted with <strong>accuracy in mind</strong>; it allows golfers to <strong>calibrate the ball’s path, spin and distance in precise measures</strong>. Irons are most helpful in teeing grounds or when on the green.<br><br></p> <h3 style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Putter</strong><img alt="" src="/img/news/golf-equipment-5.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"> </h3> <p>Putters are <strong>flat faced clubs that are primarily used to roll the ball along the grass</strong>. Golfers often use putters on the green and from a fringe to the green towards the cup. The importance of the putter can be best realized when it is asserted that golfers who are skilled in putting tend to score substantially higher than their peers in the game. The <strong>type of putter used is as important as the golfer’s delivery</strong> in this subtle phase of golfing.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Golf Tee</strong></h3> <p>A <span style="color: #b45f06;"><strong>tee</strong></span> is an object (wooden or plastic) that is pushed into or placed on the ground to rest a ball on top of for an easier shot; however, this is <strong>only allowed for the first stroke</strong> (<em>tee shot</em> or <em>drive</em>) <strong>of each hole</strong>.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/golf-equipment-6.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>Conventional golf tees are basically spikes with a small cup on the head to hold the ball, and are usually made of wood or plastic. <strong>Wooden tees</strong> are generally <strong>very inexpensive and quite disposable</strong>; a player may damage or break many of these during the course of a round. <strong>Plastic tees</strong> are generally <strong>more expensive but last longer</strong>. The length of tees varies according to the club intended to be used and by personal preference; longer tees (3-3.5") allow the player to position the ball higher off the ground while remaining stable when planted, and are generally used for modern deep-faced woods.</p> <p>They can be planted deeper for use with other clubs but then tend to break more often. Shorter tees (1.5-2.5") are suitable for irons and are more easily inserted and less easily broken than long tees. Other designs of tee exist; the "step tee" is milled or molded with a spool-shaped upper half, and so generally provides a consistent ball height from shot to shot.</p> <p>The "brush tee" uses a collection of stiff bristles instead of a cup to position the ball; the design is touted by its manufacturer as providing less interference to the ball or club at impact, for a straighter, longer flight. Alternately, the rules allow for a mound of sand to be used for the same function, also only on the first shot.</p> <p>Before the invention of the wooden spike tee, this was the only accepted method of lifting the ball for the initial shot. This is rarely done in modern times, as a tee is easier to place, hit from, and recover, but some courses prohibit the use of tees either for traditional reasons, or because a swing that hits the tee will drive it into or rip it out of the ground, resulting in damage to the turf of the tee-box. Tees also create litter if discarded incorrectly when broken.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Golf Cart</strong></h3> <p style="float: left;">Golf carts are vehicles <strong>used to transport golf bags and golfers along the golf course during a round of golf</strong>. Hand carts are designed to hold only the bag, and are used by players while walking along the course to relieve them of the weight of the <strong>bag</strong>.<br><br><a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/"><img alt="" src="/img/news/golf-equipment-7.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></a>Carts that carry both player and bag are more common on public golf courses; most of these are powered by a battery and electric motors, though gasoline-powered carts are sometimes used by course staff, and some courses and players are beginning to explore alternatives such as bicycle-drawn carts. For more product specially <a href="https://golfgearsdirect.com.au/collections/golf-bags" title="golf bags"><strong>golf bags</strong></a>, <a href="https://golfgearsdirect.com.au/collections/electric-golf" title="electric golf"><strong>electric golf</strong></a> just visit online stores like: <a href="https://golfgearsdirect.com.au/">golfgearsdirect.com.au</a> <br><br>The traditional way to play was to walk, but the<strong> use of golf carts is very common due to a number of factors</strong>. Chief among them is the sheer length of the modern course, and the required "pace of play" instituted by many courses to prevent delays for other golfers and maintain a schedule of tee times. A typical par-72 course would "measure out" at between 6,000 and 7,000 total yards, which does not count the distance between the green of one hole and the tee of the next, nor the additional distance caused by errant shots.<br><br>A player walking a 7,000-yard course might traverse up to 5 miles (8km). With a typical required pace of play of 4 hours, a player would spend 1.6 hours of that time simply walking to their next shot, leaving an average of only two minutes for all players to make each of the 72 shots for a par score (and most casual players do not score the course par).<br><br>Economics is another reason why carts have become prevalent at many courses; the <strong>fee for renting a cart is less expensive than paying a caddie to carry the bags</strong>, and the <strong>private club gets the money for the cart rentals</strong>. A golf cart also enables physically handicapped people to play the game. <strong>Carts are also popular with golfers who are too lazy to walk the course.</strong><br><br>The use of carts <strong>may be restricted by local rules</strong>. Courses may institute rules such as "90 degree paths", where <strong>drivers must stay on the cart path until level with their ball</strong>, and then may turn onto the course.<br><br>This typically <strong>reduces the effect that the furrows from the cart wheels will have on balls</strong>. Soft ground due to rain or recent maintenance work may require a "cart path only" driving rule to protect the turf, and a similar policy may apply in general to the areas around tee boxes and greens (and on shorter par-3 holes where fairway shots are not expected). The use of carts is banned altogether at most major PGA tournaments; players walk the course assisted by a caddy who carries equipment.

Some of these towels can be quite specialized, with a carabiner or other clip to attach it to the bag with a grommet used on the towel for durability, and incorporating rougher materials in certain sections of the towel for club and ball cleaning with softer weaves elsewhere for drying. Other cleaning products abound, from motorized ball cleaners to an array of brushes for various types of clubs as well as balls and shoes.<br><br><br></p> <h3> <strong>Ball Mark Repair Tools</strong> </h3> <p>A <strong>ball mark repair tool</strong> (also known as a<strong> pitchfork or divot tool</strong>) is <strong>used to repair a ball mark</strong> (a depression in the green where a ball has hit the ground on its approach shot). Some tees contain such a tool at the end, for pure convenience when on the green.<strong><br></strong></p> <p>To repair a ball mark, one pushes the tool next to the mark and pushes gently inwards from all sides, loosening the compacted turf to allow rapid regrowth of grass, and then flattens the mark with the smooth flat bottom of the putter to smooth the putting surface.<br><br><br></p> <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Golf Clothing And Shoes</strong></h2> <h3> <br><strong>Comfortable, Stylish Clothing:</strong> </h3> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/golf-equipment-9.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">You will be on the golf course for up to five hours, or more, so you need to wear clothing that's comfortable. But that doesn't mean that you abandon the essence of style. First, make sure that what you wear is loose-fitting and coordinated. <br><br>For example, think twice about <a href="https://golfgearsdirect.com.au/blogs/news/golfers-dressed-to-knock-socks-off" title="Dressed To Knock Socks Off (or Not)"><strong>wearing a pair of green striped shorts with a blue polka dot top</strong></a>. It's <strong>OK to wear</strong> loud colors, but be sure they match. And what you wear should be loose-fitting because you will constantly tax your clothing with every swing.<br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Hats Are In!</strong></h3> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/golf-equipment-10.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">Watch the touring golf professionals on television and you'll see that the vast majority of them wear some type of hat. They <strong>range from simple visors to more ornate hats with brims and colors</strong>. Those who wear them are making more than a fashion statement.<br><br>They are <strong>protecting themselves from the sun which effects everyone's game</strong>. Whether you have skin that is sensitive to the sun, or you need to shield your eyes from the sun's glare, having on the right hat is both utilitarian and nice to wear.<br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Shoes:</strong></h3> <p>There was a time when you could only get <a href="https://golfgearsdirect.com.au/blogs/news/get-dressed-for-the-game" title="Get Dressed for the Game"><strong>golf shoes</strong> <strong>with metal spikes</strong></a>. Now many courses outlaw them in favor of shoes with so-called <strong>"soft spikes"</strong>, because metal spiked shoes damage the greens. Before you buy a pair, check with the course you usually play for clarification. <br><br> Be sure that the <strong><span style="color: #b45f06;">golf shoes</span> you buy are a good fit</strong> because you will walk up to six or more miles every time you play 18 holes. There's nothing worse than having an ill-fitting pair of golf shoes that cause blisters on your feet before the round is over. <br><br> Because they are stiff when they are new, consider wearing them around the house to break them in before taking them onto the golf course. Finally, keep your golf shoes in good shape. <strong>Regularly change all the spikes and polish them</strong>. Remember, you will see them each time you address the golf ball on the golf course.<br><br><br></p> <h2><strong>Prepare For Bad Weather</strong></h2> <p>You never realize <strong>how important appropriate weather gear</strong> is until you run into bad conditions without it. If there is a chance for the temperature to drop during your round, have a sweater or a jacket handy.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/golf-equipment-11.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>If it should rain on the golf course consider investing in <strong>water-repellent golf pants and coat</strong>. Most golf bags have large pockets where those items can be stored.<br><br><br></p> <h3><a href="https://amzn.to/2PeLnHf%EF%BB%BF" title="Callaway Men's Thermal Grip Golf Gloves (Pack of 2), Cadet Medium, Ambidextrous" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Gloves:</strong></a></h3> <p>Are worn by golfers to secure a good grip on the club and to prevent blisters from hard and rough <strong>golf equipment.</strong></p> <p>Golf gloves are often sold by piece and players usually wear gloves on the non-dominant hand, although some players wear gloves in both hands to reduce soreness and irritation caused by continuous friction. <br><br><br></p> <p>Above post gives details about basic golf equipment, like golf ball, <strong>golf bag</strong> used while playing golf.
