<p>There are <strong>at least twenty professional golf tours</strong>, each run by a PGA or an independent tour organization, which is responsible for arranging events, finding sponsors, and regulating the tour. Typically a tour has "members" who are entitled to compete in most of its events, and also invites non-members to compete in some of them. <strong>Gaining membership of an elite tour is highly competitive</strong>, and <strong>most professional golfers</strong> <strong>never achieved it</strong>.</p> <p><strong>There are enormous differences in the financial rewards offered by the various golf tours</strong>, so players on all but the top few tours always aspire to move up if they can. For example, the PGA Tour, which is the first-tier tour in the United States, offers nearly a hundred times as much prize money each season as the third-tier NGA Pro Golf Tour.

In most events individual players all compete against each other for the lowest total score. Some tournaments involve a <strong>series of individual matches between two golfers</strong>. Players can also be grouped into teams and compete against other groups in one of several different ways. <br><br><br></p> <ul> <li><span style="color: #274e13; font-size: 15px;"><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Stroke Play</strong></span></li> </ul> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">The <strong>most common tournament format</strong> is individual stroke play, also called <strong>medal play</strong>. It is the overwhelming choice for professional events as well as local amateur tournaments. Out of more than 40 events each year on the PGA Tour, all but one is a stroke play event. The winner in this format is the one with the lowest overall score, either for a single round or for a number of rounds. In most amateur events the scores are net scores based on the players’ handicaps, but professional and high-level amateur tournaments use gross scores.<strong><br></strong></p> <ul> <li><span style="color: #274e13; font-size: 15px;"><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Match Play</strong></span></li> </ul> <p style="float: right; padding-left: 30px;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/golf-tour-10.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">Match play <strong>consists of a series of one-hole contests between two players</strong>, and the one who wins the most holes over the round is the winner. With a large field of golfers, many matches are required to decide a winner.<br><br>Once the preferred format for high-level competitions, there is now only one match play tournament each year on the PGA Tour. The United States Golf Association and regional amateur golf associations still conduct many of their championships using match play.<br><br></p> <ul> <li><span style="color: #274e13; font-size: 15px;"><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Stableford</strong></span></li> </ul> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">A<strong> less common individual competition format</strong> is Stableford, where players <strong>win points for their scores on each hole</strong>. The player with the highest point total at the end wins the event. Up until 2007 there was one Stableford competition on the PGA Tour.

Teams usually compete against all the other teams in medal play using either gross or net scores. In some tournaments like the international Ryder Cup competitions, teams play against each other in match play, and sometimes play “foursomes” matches where the two teams alternate shots and play only one ball.</p> <ul> <li><span style="color: #274e13; font-size: 15px;"><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Scramble</strong></span></li> </ul> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/golf-tour-11.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">A <strong>popular format used in less formal tournaments</strong> is the scramble. It is a team competition that is suitable for players of vastly different skill levels. Teams usually consist of four players. For each stroke the team members select the best of their previous shots and all play their next shots from that position. The procedure continues until someone holes their ball. The event can be handicapped but it is difficult to do in a fair manner. There often are limitations on the skill level of players allowed on the same team and the number of drives required from each player.
