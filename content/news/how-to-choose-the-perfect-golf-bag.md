These bags are designed to be lightweight to reduce the strain on your back as you walk along the course.<br><br>The good thing about this type of golf bag is that, they are l<strong>ightweight, easy to transport</strong>, and are <strong>designed for recreational and casual golfers</strong>. It has a <strong>shoulder strap</strong> which makes it easier for golfers to carry around and is best for those of you who prefer walking the course, or often they have <strong>backpack-like straps</strong> so you can pick them up quickly and be on your way.<br><br>Some have stands so you can sit them upright to remove your clubs.Carry bag is made of nylon or plastic material instead of leather, so just hold a basic set of golf clubs, as well as your <a href="https://amzn.to/2vKtDwa" target="_blank" title="Callaway Performance Tee" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>tees</strong> </a>and <strong>golf balls</strong>. <br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Staff Bags</strong></h3> <ul></ul> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/how-to-choose-the-perfect-golf-bag-5.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">If you always have a <a href="https://golfgearsdirect.com.au/blogs/news/the-golfer-s-butler" title="The Golfer's Butler "><strong>Caddie</strong></a> walking with you the entire time you are golfing, then choosing staff bags will be good for you, but if you don’t, you may get exhausted of lugging around the extra weight whether that means <a href="https://golfgearsdirect.com.au/collections/push-golf" title="push golf"><strong>pushing it on a hand cart</strong></a> throughout the round or even just carrying it from your car to the riding cart and back.<br><br>This type of golf bag is quite large in size (at about 8 to 12 inches in diameter) and can really be heavy. <strong>Staff bags are designed to carry an entire set of golf clubs</strong> as well as all those <strong>golf accessories</strong> the golfer could possibly have or need.<br><br>It is often used by <a href="https://golfgearsdirect.com.au/blogs/news/golf-tour" title="Golf Tours "><strong>professional golfers</strong> <strong>when they are on tour</strong></a>, and is considered as the top of the line when it comes to golf bags.Staff bags tend to tip the scales around 10 pounds, but what they lack in lightness, they more than make up for in higher quality materials, plentiful storage space, and Tour-worthy aesthetics.<br><br><br></p> <h3>Cart Bags</h3> <ul></ul> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/how-to-choose-the-perfect-golf-bag-6.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"><strong>Cart bags </strong>are <strong>slightly smaller and noticeably lighter than the staff bags</strong>.

And of course, if you use a riding cart, these are perfectly designed for that use.What makes these bags work so well for carts is that they're designed to provide easy access to all the bag's pockets while remaining strapped to the back of your riding cart or pull cart.<br><br>Another feature most cart bags have is a rubber or non-slip base that will keep the bag from sliding off the cart.<br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Stand Bags</strong></h3> <ul></ul> <p>Stand Bags are considered as the<strong> most versatile type of golf bag</strong>. They are usually light in weight but heavier than a carry bag.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/how-to-choose-the-perfect-golf-bag-7.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>They feature a design that's unique compared to other styles of golf bag—they have two retractable legs that keep everything upright and accessible during your round.<br><br>They are a great choice for either walking or using a golf cart.

But if you walk the course, there's no need for your clubs to stay on the cart path when you're teeing off or lining up a putt.<br><br><strong>Note:</strong> Stand bags can be used with push or pull carts or strapped to the back of a riding cart.
