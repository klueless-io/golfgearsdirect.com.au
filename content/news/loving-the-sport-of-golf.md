<p>As a sport, golf is a choice. Some people may find this game boring, while some choose to spend their free time playing this game.<br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Health Benefits</strong></h3> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/loving-the-sport-of-golf-1.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">We enjoy light exercise when we play this game outdoors, with plenty of fresh air and sunshine.

Spouses may play golf with one another; siblings find golf as a way to keep in touch with one another and long lost friends renew their friendship bond by playing this game on a weekend.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/loving-the-sport-of-golf-3.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>Persons who enjoy playing golf for the sheer fun of the sport may also be spending time with business contacts, or having fun with family and friends, but the root of the attraction remains a love of the sport itself.</p> <p>Its quality time with one’s family, bringing the whole family in the golf course, makes the most of your time.

Golfers play this game in order to 'come up against ourselves' in the presence of others. This is a great experience when you're playing with three strangers or the same group of guys for the past twenty years. They are witness to your struggles and successes... and you are witness to theirs.<br><br>Various factors<strong> </strong>are taken into consideration when playing this game, most often beyond the golfer’s control. These are all taken into account.</p> <ul> <li>Wind speed</li> <li>Wind direction</li> <li>Fairway slope</li> <li>Club limitations</li> <li>Ball placement and more.</li> </ul> <p>Then the whole analysis comes down to one simple swing that's over in seconds. It's fun (or sometimes not so much) to see the results immediately where in business it may take weeks, months, or years to see the results of a strategic decision.</p> <p>It's incredibly satisfying when you hit the ball just perfectly. As others have mentioned, the feel of striking the ball purely and watching it pierce the air like a bullet -- or, at the other end of the shot-making spectrum, float on the wind, balloon-like -- is, very arguably, euphoria unmatched in any other sport.</p> <p>Golf is a sport and teaches a person great attributes to his personality and the way he approaches things today. Patience (golf takes over three hours to play). It is also important to stay calm when you mess things up; it really is a mental game with yourself! You have the opportunity to better yourself with each hole.</p> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/loving-the-sport-of-golf-5.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">Self-improvement, Determination, Focus, Respect for others (you should remain quiet when others are playing),taking the time to connect with nature. This is a great way to get to know someone, your true personality usually surfaces when you place golf. Golf is more than a sport. It provides physical and mental challenge. It is fosters bonding, friendship, business opportunities, and clean fun.<br><br>I think some people can't stop because of the addictive nature of the game. There's always room for improvement and instruction is getting better and better, our understanding of the swing and putting or the documentation of it has made great strides recently.</p> <p><br>You can shoot a personal best and still think you left a couple of shots out there. When you get better, you never, ever, get tired of seeing your well struck shot, the trajectory, the way it pierces through the air, the sound of a violently spinning ball.<br><br>Golf is a game where your performance and competition of the game is directly related to your skill and that doesn't require an enormous amount of physical talent. <br><br>Golf is all about perfection and every single round are different, applying what you learn in the golf course to your life has great benefits and you become a smarter and better person.<br><br><br></p> <h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Why Is Golfing Associated With Rich People?</strong></h3> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/loving-the-sport-of-golf-6.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>On courses where golf is cheaper, it’s one of the favorite pastimes of all sorts of people. However, a <strong>golf course is expensive to maintain</strong>, so if you’re going to shoot for “country-club level” amenities and course conditions, it’s going to have to be more expensive than $40 a round. You can also check and get some ideas in some golf books like: <a href="https://amzn.to/2NznY2z" target="_blank" title="Golf Course Design" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Golf Course Design (amazon)</strong></a> as t<span>his book covers all aspects of golf course design and construction.</span></p> <p><strong>Golf courses </strong>are expensive to build and expensive to maintain. An 18 hole golf course requires at least 110 acres, sometimes 200 acres. Most of that acreage has to be watered and mowed every day. Fertilizer, weed killer, and insecticide are applied several times per season. For most of golf’s history, all this work was done by individuals.

For all but the most popular times, there are many fewer players. And for some of the year courses are closed because of cold and snow. So the course expenses aren’t spread over very many golfers.<br><br>Playing golf is expensive. Golf takes time. Modern courses do everything they can to speed up play but a nominal round takes 4 1/4 hours.<br><br>At crowded times they can easily take 5 hours. With travel, getting ready, and maybe having a drink with your partners after the round, that’s probably 6 hours when you aren’t working and aren’t doing chores at home.<br><br>Up until the 1960s, most golf courses in most of the US were owned by country clubs. Membership in country clubs was expensive. And country clubs weren’t just associated with rich people but with elites.
