<h3><strong>(Annika Sorenstam)</strong></h3> <p>Swedish star Annika Sorenstam is one of the best players, male or female, in the history of golf. This hard-working young woman has shattered numerous records in the course of her career; in 2001 alone she tied or broke thirty of them. Yet even though her dominance in the sport of golf seems nearly unchallenged, she still continues to push herself to work harder and to further improve her game.<br><br><br></p> <p><strong>Early Influences:</strong></p> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-greatest-female-golfer-of-all-time-1.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">Sorenstam grew up in a golfing family-her mother and father are both good recreational players, and her younger sister Charlotta is also on the Ladies Professional Golf Association(LPGA) Tour-but Annika's first sports love was tennis. Swedish tennis star of the late 1970s and early 1980s Bjorn Borg was her hero, and for seven years, starting at age five, Sorenstam tried to learn how to emulate him. <br><br>She only turned to golf as a potential career when she was 12, but by age 14 she had joined the Swedish junior golf program. Sorenstam's father worked for IBM when she was a child, and from him she acquired another enduring love: computers. She combines this passion with her golf by keeping detailed statistics of her rounds, as she has done since she was 14. By examining the charts and graphs that she created from her statistics, Sorenstam can easily see where the flaws in her playing are and work to improve them. <br><br>Sorenstam joined the Swedish national golf team in 1987, when she was still a teenager. There she fell under the influence of the team's coach, Pia Nilsson. Nilsson taught her players to think about golf with "54-vision": golfers should think that it is possible to birdie (shoot a score of one less stroke than par on a hole) every hole of a <a href="https://golfgearsdirect.com.au/blogs/news/golf-course-introduction" title="Golf Course Introduction "><strong>golf course </strong></a>and then should visualize themselves doing just that.</p> <p>No one has ever actually scored a 54, of course, but still, it was the goal her team was to shoot for. If you are looking for amazing <a href="https://golfgearsdirect.com.au/collections/all" title="golf equipment "><strong>golf equipment</strong></a> just visit here: <a href="https://golfgearsdirect.com.au/">golfgearsdirect.com.au</a>.<br><br><br></p> <h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Becoming A Professional</strong></h3> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-greatest-female-golfer-of-all-time-2.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>Sorenstam played golf for the University of Arizona for two years, from 1990 until 1992. She was the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) champion in 1991, but after the 1992 college season she quit school to become a professional. Sorenstam joined the <a href="https://golfgearsdirect.com.au/blogs/news/golf-tour" title="Golf Tours "><strong>LPGA Tour</strong></a> in 1993, and by the end of the 1994 season she had finished in the top ten at LPGA events five times. She got her first victory ever on the tour in 1995, at the U.S.</p> <p>Women's Open, and after that she seemed to be unstoppable. By the end of the 1996 season Sorenstam had won four more tournaments, two Vare Trophies, and one Player of the Year award.</p> <p>Sorenstam's dominance, however, was slowly being challenged by a phenomenal young Australian named Karrie Webb.</p> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-greatest-female-golfer-of-all-time-3.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">Although Sorenstam continued to improve, Webb had a better seasonal scoring average than Sorenstam did in three years, was named player of the year twice, and won seven tournaments to Sorenstam's five in 2000.<br><br>But Webb's presence actually encouraged Sorenstam to be a better player. "If Karrie wins five tournaments, it makes for tougher expectations and makes me think, 'What else do I have to do?' I really want to reach my goals and I have the extra desire now to play.<br><br>I wake up every morning wanting to practice," she told Tom Spousta of Golf World early in 2001. Sorenstam concentrated particularly on improving her putting, but she also worked to increase her strength. As a result she added 15 yards to her drives.<br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Two Historic Seasons</strong></h3> <p style="float: left;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annika_S%C3%B6renstam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-greatest-female-golfer-of-all-time-4.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></a>Sorenstam's hard work paid off in the 2001 and 2002 seasons, as she became a breathtakingly consistent golfing machine. In 2001 Sorenstam reclaimed the Vare Trophy with a 69.42 scoring average, only one one-hundredth of a point below Webb's record-breaking 1999 average, and then in 2002 Sorenstam shattered her own record with a 68.70. <br><br>She hit the fairway from the<a href="https://amzn.to/2vKtDwa" target="_blank" title="Callaway Performance Tee" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong> tee</strong></a> and the green from the fairway 80 percent of the time, which made her the most accurate golfer, male or female, in the world.<br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annika_S%C3%B6renstam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-greatest-female-golfer-of-all-time-5.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></a>Armed with her new strength and her consistency, Sorenstam shot the best single round of golf ever by a woman on the LPGA <u>Tour</u> at the Standard.

She scored a 59, something that only six male golfers have done. Had she not missed a 9-foot putt on the last hole, Sorenstam could have claimed the scoring record all for herself:<br><br>No one on the Professional Golfers' Association or LPGA Tour has ever scored a 58 in competition. Nilsson was in the gallery at that event, watching her former pupil put the "54-vision" into practice.|<br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Chronology</strong></h3> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>1970</strong></p> </td> <td> <p>Born October 9 in Stockholm, Sweden, to Tom and Gunilla Sorenstam</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>1987</strong></p> </td> <td> <p>Joins the Swedish national golf team</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>1990</strong></p> </td> <td> <p>Enrolls at the University of Arizona</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>1992</strong></p> </td> <td> <p>Quits college to become a professional</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>1993</strong></p> </td> <td> <p>Joins the LPGA Tour</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>1997</strong></p> </td> <td> <p>Marries David Esch January 4</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><br>In 2002 Sorenstam tied another longstanding record by winning 13 tournaments in a single season, something that had been done only once before, by Mickey Wright. Sorenstam's achievement was even more impressive because she compiled her 13 wins in only 25 tournaments, while Wright played in 33 in 1963.

"I want to play 2004 as a Hall of Famer," she told Sports Illustrator’s Michael Bamberger after the 2002 season, but after that, I don't know.<br><br>I want to be a mother. I don't think I can be a mother and devote myself to golf the way I need to. I'm too competitive." That competitiveness means that, even though she is already one of the best golfers in history, she continues to work on improving her strength.<br><br>Her hard work should ensure at least two more phenomenal seasons from Sorenstam, and perhaps a few more records to remember her by when she is gone.<br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Awards and Accomplishmentsfrom 1991 to 2002<br><br></strong></h3> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>1991</strong></p> </td> <td> <p>Becomes NCAA Champion</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>1991</strong></p> </td> <td> <p>Named NCAA Co-College Player of the Year</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>1991-92</strong></p> </td> <td> <p>Named an NCAA All-American</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>1992</strong></p> </td> <td> <p>Named World Amateur Champion</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>1992</strong></p> </td> <td> <p>Named PAC-10 Champion</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>1994</strong></p> </td> <td> <p>Named Rolex Rookie of the Year</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>1994, 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002</strong></p> </td> <td> <p>Wins Solheim Cup</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>1995</strong></p> </td> <td> <p>Wins Athlete of the Year Award in Sweden</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>1995-96</strong></p> </td> <td> <p>Wins U.S. Women's Open</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>1995, 1997-98, 2001-02</strong></p> </td> <td> <p>Named Rolex Player of the Year</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>1995-96, 1998, 2001-02</strong></p> </td> <td> <p>Wins Vare Trophy for lowest scoring average</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>2001</strong></p> </td> <td> <p>Standard Register Ping (LPGA record-low score of 59 in the second round)</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>2001</strong></p> </td> <td> <p>Wins Nabisco Championship</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>2001</strong></p> </td> <td> <p>Set or tied 30 different LPGA records</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>2002</strong></p> </td> <td> <p>Wins Kraft Nabisco Championship</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h3> <strong><br></strong><br><br><strong>Retirement</strong> </h3> <p style="float: left;"><a href="https://golfgearsdirect.com.au/"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-greatest-female-golfer-of-all-time-7.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></a>On 13 May 2008, Sörenstam announced at a press conference at the Sybase Classic that she would "step away" from competitive golf at the conclusion of the 2008 season. That night, she threw out the first pitch of the Washington Nationals/New York Mets baseball game at Shea Stadium in New York and the following day read the Top Ten on the Late Show with David Letterman.<br><br>Her last tournament victory came in a playoff at the Suzhou Taihu Ladies Open, an event co-sanctioned by the Ladies European Tour and the Ladies Asian Golf tour. Her last scheduled tournament on the LPGA Tour was the season-ending ADT Championship in November, where she failed to make the weekend play in the event's unique playoff structure. <br><br>Her final sanctioned LPGA appearance was as the winning captain of Team International at the 2008 Lexus Cup in Singapore. Her last professional tournament was the Dubai Ladies Masters on the Ladies European Tour in December 2008, where she finished tied for 7th.
