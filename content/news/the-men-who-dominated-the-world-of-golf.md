<p>(<span style="color: #0000ff;">World Famous and Record-Breaking Men in the History of the Game</span>)</p> <p>Over the last century, golf has emerged as one of the biggest and most widely played sports in the world. The rise of golf, both in America and around the world, has brought fame and riches to many, many men, and today it could be argued that professional golf has never been more popular.But today’s players owe an awful lot to those who came before them, as some of the greatest golfers of all time paved the way for today’s young stars and brought popularity to the sport.<br><br><br></p> <h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #990000;"><strong>Records are Made to be Broken</strong></span></h2> <p style="text-align: center;">(Record-Breaking Men in the World of Golf)</p> <h3><strong>New Guinness World Record for Speed Golf</strong></h3> <p>Slow play has been a long curse of the game golf, but not when <span style="color: #0b5394;"><strong>Steve Jeffs</strong></span> is about.</p> <p style="float: left;"><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/01/16/golf/speed-golf-world-record/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-men-who-dominated-the-world-of-golf-1.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></a>The Briton is the<strong> new world record holder</strong> for the "<strong>fastest hole of golf</strong>" after completing a 500-yard par-five hole in just one minute and 50.6 seconds.<br><br>The 31-year-old physical education teacher's lung-busting record was set at the UK's Tiverton Golf Club last August and was recently ratified by The Guinness World Records. His time betters a mark of one minute 52 seconds set by fellow Brit Phil Naylor back in 2005. According to The Guinness World Records, the <strong>rule for the record</strong> attempt is that the <strong>hole must be at least 500 yards long</strong>.<br><br>The clock begins the moment the ball is first struck by the <a href="https://amzn.to/2MUWibl" target="_blank" title="Cobra Men's Golf Club " rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Golf Club </strong></a>and stops when it drops into the hole. The golfer can <a href="https://golfgearsdirect.com.au/blogs/news/golf-buggies" title="Golf Buggies "><strong>ride in a cart</strong></a> with his <a href="https://golfgearsdirect.com.au/collections/all" title="golf equipment "><strong>Golf equipment</strong></a>, but must finish the hole with as many clubs as they started with. He chose to sprint between the shots instead of riding a cart, but on the day of the record attempt he almost ran out of puff.<br><br>He only has three attempts and his first two was a complete fail.The nine handicapper had just enough in the tank for one final attempt, taking three shots to get onto the green before stopping the clock with the simplest of tap-ins after his first putt rolled up millimeters short of the cup.<br><br><br></p> <p style="float: left;"> </p> <p style="float: left;"> </p> <p style="float: left;">As the news sunk in, Jeffs dropped to his knees in joyful exhaustion before being swamped by well-wishers including his wife Kelly who had been holding the flag. Jeffs is an enthusiastic promoter of speed golf -- a fast-paced version of the game where players complete 18 holes in about 80-90 minutes.The father of two is hopeful his new record-breaking feat will inspire his daughters and encourage more people to take up the sport.

At long last, we finally have a 62 at the men's golf major championships. After years of challenges and multiple 18th hole interventions from unseen forces that made it seem like we'd never get a 62, Branden Grace finally delivered the magic number at The Open Championship.<br><br>Grace is super talented and has contended at multiple majors in his young career, but this was flawless from start to finish and the biggest moment of his career. Grace called it a "special day" and he didn't even have to sweat it out on the 18th hole as we've seen on an almost annual basis with all the 63s over the years. Grace needed only a tap-in par to set the new record and post an 8-under 62 that has him now tied for second place at the 146th Open.<br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Rhein Gibson’s 55</strong></h3> <p>Australian professional golfer <span style="color: #0b5394;"><strong>Rhein Gibson</strong></span> has provisionally set a new world record for the <strong>lowest round in golf</strong>, shooting a 16-under-par 55 at the River Oaks Golf Club in Oklahoma.The 26-year-old from Lismore in New South Wales was playing at his 'local' course in Oklahoma with two friends, having spent his college years in the area with Oklahoma Christian University. Only Homero Blancas, a PGA Tour player from the 1960s, has ever recorded a 55 before, but on a par-70 course of just 5000 yards.</p> <p>This score was originally in the Guinness Book of World Records but taken out after harder qualifying rules were set.Gibson's round falls into the record parameters and, once cleared, will be a new world mark. Starting on the back nine of the 6698-yard par-71 course, Gibson started with a routine par before notching up two eagles and a birdie in his next three holes. He then continued his birdie blitz with five straight to close out a mind-boggling nine holes in 26 shots, 10 under par.Forced to wait 15 minutes at the turn Gibson could only manage pars on the first two holes but then birdied six of the last seven to post an incredible 55.<br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Fastest Hole of Golf by Team</strong></h3> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-men-who-dominated-the-world-of-golf-3.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">England broke the world record for the <strong>fastest hole of golf by a team of four</strong> - before pulling a fast one on unsuspecting team member Matthew Southgate.<br><br>The English quartet of Tyrrell Hatton, Matt Fitzpatrick, Ian Poulter and Southgate completed the par-five 15th at Regnum Carya Golf Resort and Spa in Antalya in 32.70 seconds to set a new Guinness World Record time.<br><br>That was just 0.26secs quicker than the South African team of Brandon Stone, Haydn Porteous, Dylan Frittelli and George Coetzee, but took 2.17s off the previous best set by France at Valderrama last year. England's reward is a place in the record books and a certificate for each member of the team, although Southgate was then persuaded they had also won £50,000 each.<br><br><br></p> <h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #990000;"><strong>Greatest Golfers of All Time</strong></span></h2> <p style="text-align: center;">(<span style="color: #0000ff;">World’s Most Famous Men in the History of Golf</span>)</p> <h3><a href="https://golfgearsdirect.com.au/blogs/news/be-like-tiger" title="Be Like Tiger "><strong>Tiger Woods</strong></a></h3> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-men-who-dominated-the-world-of-golf-4.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">When it comes to the game of Golf, who wouldn’t know, or haven’t heard of the name Tiger Woods?
