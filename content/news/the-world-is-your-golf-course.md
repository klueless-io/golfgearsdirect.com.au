<p>(<strong>The Best Golf Courses around the World</strong>)<br><br></p> <p>Aside From your <a href="https://golfgearsdirect.com.au/blogs/news/golf-equipment" title="Golf Equipment "><strong>golf equipment</strong></a>, like your <a href="https://amzn.to/2vQ5bcw" target="_blank" title="Callaway Men's Strata Plus Set " rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>golf clubs</strong></a> and, of course, your golf outfit (it is next to golf clubs when it comes its importance), you need a place to play golf too, right?</p> <p>Golf courses have always been recognized for their natural beauty and tranquility. With the silence broken only by the swishing of golf clubs, clinking of balls, or the warbling of the cheerful birds and the sound of the leaves rustling as the wind blows through the trees (and the occasional angry golfers that misses their shots of course), Golfers have a feeling of pure calmness as if they were worlds away from the reality. While it is often scrutinized for its abundant use of land and natural resources, the golf industry is answering back with sound programs that assist courses in measuring environmental sustainability. A course is a thing of beauty, and it takes good architecture to achieve it.<br><br><br></p> <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The World’s Greatest Golf Courses</strong></h2> <p style="text-align: center;">(<span style="color: #9900ff;">The 10 bests Golf Courses around the World</span>)</p> <p style="float: right;"><a href="https://www.golfdigest.com/story/worlds-100-greatest-golf-courses-2016-ranking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-world-is-your-golf-course-1.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></a>Throughout the history of golf design, two things have consistently been regarded as the greatest priorities for golf architects: that their courses should be a playable, interesting challenge for golfers of every standard, and that they should sit as lightly as possible on their natural environments. Not just the game alone that the golfers love, it is also the breathtaking view of the courses that they admire, the cunning strategy and the exciting challenges.
