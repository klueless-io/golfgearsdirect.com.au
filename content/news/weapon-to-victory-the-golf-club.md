I have listed here the basic guidelines to follow when beginning to select the proper equipment:<br><br></p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/weapon-to-victory-the-golf-club-1.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>You first need to know your <strong>ability level and/or handicap</strong>. If you are not sure of your ability or handicap, you can check the ones below to see where you belong. Check out <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/meet-the-golf-clubs-1560507" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golf Clubs Types</a> and familiarize your self with the different types of club.<br><br></p> <ul></ul> <h3><span style="color: #990000;"><strong>Low handicap (0-5 Handicap)</strong></span></h3> <p>You are capable of <strong>hitting both draws and fades</strong> and have a good grasp of the proper methods involved in the <a href="https://golfgearsdirect.com.au/blogs/news/golf-swing-methods" title="Golf Swing Methods "><strong>golf swing</strong></a>. You normally hit the ball in the center of the club face.<br><br><br></p> <ol></ol> <h3><span style="color: #990000;"><strong>Mid-Low Handicap (5-15 Handicap)</strong></span></h3> <p>You are <strong>a devoted golfer who always play the game</strong>. You commonly play during the weekends and consistently play well mainly on your own natural skill. It is natural for you to hit most of your clubs but there are times that you miss every once in a while.<br><br><br></p> <ol></ol> <h3><span style="color: #990000;"><strong>High-Mid Handicap (15-25) Handicap </strong></span></h3> <p>You are a you play golf out of enjoyment but not competitively and who likes to play casually every now and then or if you have a spare time. You still miss-hit the ball and most likely to have a hard time keeping it around the fairway and hitting the green.<br><br><br></p> <ol></ol> <h3><span style="color: #990000;"><strong>High Handicap (25 and above Handicap)</strong></span></h3> <p>You are a golf newbie or an elderly who has a hard time moving around compared to the younger players. You need clubs that are very forgiving. You also want clubs that will help you lift the ball off the ground by having a sole that won't dig into the turf.<br><br></p> <ol></ol> <strong>Understand what clubs and other accessories you need</strong> (and also understand their functions and use, specifically for the different kinds of clubs) to make up a complete set. The rules of the game limit you to carry a maximum of 14 clubs in your golf bag, from putter (a golf club designed for use in putting, typically with a flat-faced mallet-like head) to driver (a club that is designed to launch the ball the longest distance).<br> <ul></ul> <p>That doesn't mean you absolutely need to complete all 14 clubs that is required. A baseline set that is a good start for any golfer includes the following:<br><br></p> <ol> <li> <a href="https://amzn.to/2NtijuT" target="_blank" title=" Pinemeadow Golf Command W7X Driver " rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Driver</strong></a> (9.5 - 13 degrees loft*)</li> <li>Fairway Wood (15 - 17 degrees loft*)</li> <li>Hybrid (19 - 21 degrees loft*)</li> <li>Iron Set (4 - Pitching Wedge, Attack or Approach Wedge or Sand Wedge)</li> <li>Wedge (Sand Wedge and/or Lob Wedge)</li> <li>Putter (33", 34" or 35" degrees loft* - Length varies from user to user)<br><br> </li> </ol> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/weapon-to-victory-the-golf-club-2.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">Using the clubs above as a guide for your basic set, you can then start choosing individual clubs depending on your ability level.<br><br>Even though the clubs are just a guide, there are still an infinite arrangements and possibilities that you can do to make your own perfect set of clubs. At the end of the day, it still goes down on how you hit the club and your preference.<br><br><strong>Loft or loft angle</strong> is the <strong>angle formed by a line that runs down the center of shaft and a line running down the face of the club</strong>. The lower the loft, the farther the ball goes and the higher the loft, the steeper the angle of the ball rising into the air.<br><br></p> <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Parts of the Club</strong></h2> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/weapon-to-victory-the-golf-club-3.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>Alright, now that you have a bit blurred picture of your ideal club set on your mind, let's make it clearer by first knowing the different components that makes up a club. This will greatly help on how you handle each individual club and also to choose the ones that is very comfortable for your hand and play style.<br><br></p> <h3><a href="https://amzn.to/2LqV4jv" target="_blank" title="Winn Golf Club Grips Dritac" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Grip</strong></a></h3> <p>The grip is commonly <strong>made out of a synthetic rubber</strong> composite and are designed to match every golfer's desire. <br><br><strong>The most common designs are:</strong><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Wraps</strong></h3> <p>Got its design from the original style of leather grips that used strips of leather wrapped around the shaft. Now they use modern material to create a soft surface texture that provides a tacky touch (such as rubber or other synthetic materials).</p> <p>They are usually the <strong>cheapest of the three designs</strong> (and fairly the most common). They are <strong>designed to be perform well especially when wet</strong> (in the rain and with sweaty hands). Wrap grips can help golfer with<a href="https://golfgearsdirect.com.au/blogs/news/golf-grip-tips" title="Grip Tips "><strong> proper hand placement</strong></a> which is ideal for beginner golfers.<br><br><br></p> <h3> <strong>Cords</strong> </h3> <p>Is actually the <strong>inside material of the golf grip pulled through to the outside</strong>. The addition of this material helps to provide more traction in your hands in the rain as well as hotter, sweatier weather. Cords have a tough feel to them, are very durable and offer a responsive feel when hitting the golf ball. <strong>Cords are much more expensive compared to the common wrap grip</strong>.<br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Non-corded </strong></h3> <p>Non-corded grips are <strong>smooth and seamless</strong> and are made of materials such as <strong>wood, iron or rubber</strong>. They <strong>eliminate the feel of impact on the hands</strong>.<br><br><br></p> <ol></ol> <h3><strong>Shaft</strong></h3> <p>The club's shaft is <strong>what connects the grip to the club head</strong>. The shaft <strong>acts as an extension of your arms</strong> as it allows you to control the club head at any direction and speed. <br><br><strong>Golf club shafts are either made of:</strong></p> <ul></ul> <ul> <li><span style="color: #bf9000; font-size: 15px;"><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Steel </strong></span></li> </ul> <p style="float: left; padding-left: 30px;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/weapon-to-victory-the-golf-club-4.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">A steel shaft is <strong>heavier than graphite</strong> and imparts more vibrations up the shaft to the player's hands both on solid and miss-hit golf shots (which is very helpful for players who "feel" their every shot and bases their corrections on every vibrational feedback from the shaft). Steel shafts also have a<strong> stiffer flex and less torque</strong>. <br><br> Players with a high swing speed may find that this fits their swing tempo better and allows them more control. Players who tend to swing too fast also will benefit from heavier clubs. These characteristics generally make steel shafts more accurate than graphite.</p> <ul> <li><span style="color: #bf9000; font-size: 15px;"><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Graphite </strong></span></li> </ul> <p style="float: right; padding-left: 30px;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/weapon-to-victory-the-golf-club-5.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">The benefit of graphite shaft is it's <strong>lighter than steel shafts</strong>, resulting in an increased torque, thus giving a significant increase in swing speed and distance, thus aid in increased club-head speed and higher golf shots. This is particularly beneficial to players with slow swing tempos and most golfers can see an increase of at least 5 yards for each club.<br><br>Graphite shafts greatly dampens the vibration at impact and some golfers prefer this, especially those who have frequent miss-hits. The <strong>player-friendly characteristics of graphite</strong> tend to <strong>make it the shaft of choice</strong> for<strong><a href="https://golfgearsdirect.com.au/blogs/news/kids-golf" title="Getting Your Kids Into The Game "> beginners, children</a>, high-handicappers and for someone who has hand, arm or shoulder problems</strong>.<br><br>Once you choose steel or graphite, there is also the flex to consider. <strong>Flex</strong> refers to the <strong>amount of "bowing" the shaft has during the swing</strong>. The faster your swing speed, the stiffer the shaft flex you will need.</p> <ul> <li><span style="color: #bf9000; font-size: 15px;"><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Hosel</strong></span></li> </ul> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">The <strong>shaft is inserted into the <a href="https://amzn.to/2N7QCYJ" target="_blank" title=" Adjustable Hosel for Cobra King LTD Driver Black" rel="noopener noreferrer">hosel</a></strong>, which <strong>pretty looks like</strong> the <strong>neck of the club head</strong> and connects the shaft to the club head and controls the lie angle of the club (The lie angle is a measured angle between the sole of the club head and the shaft). Players sometimes need their lie angles corrected based on their height, arm length or swing style.</p> <ul></ul> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Some clubs use a <strong>bore-thru design</strong> rather than <strong>using a hosel</strong>. <strong>Bore-thru club heads</strong> have a <strong>hole in the heel of the club</strong> that runs entirely through the head, and the shaft is installed into this hole.<br><br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Club Head </strong></h3> <p>The <strong>final component is the club head</strong>. This is the part of the club that <strong>actually hits the ball</strong>. It controls the trajectory and eventually the distance that the ball will travel.<br><br>Club heads are designed with <strong>either titanium, steel, tungsten or an alloy of those metals</strong>. The club head is the <strong>heaviest component of the golf club</strong>. The face of the club has scorelines or grooves on it. The grooves serve provides spin on the golf ball and to take away moisture between the ball and the club face.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/weapon-to-victory-the-golf-club-6.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>As you can see out there in the market, the <strong>club head is the main feature of any club</strong> and is usually the first thing a golfer will decide upon before any other factors or features. Different manufacturers create different club heads that are geared towards a particular player's ability by using their own specific technology, but at the end of the day, they all perform the same job, and that is to strike the golf ball and propel it forward, towards the hole.</p> <p>Now that you have already familiarized yourself on the components or parts of the golf club, now it's time to see the different golf clubs that you will need.<br><br><br></p> <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Types of Golf Clubs</strong></h2> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/weapon-to-victory-the-golf-club-7.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>There are traditionally <strong>3 kinds of golf clubs</strong> out there, <strong>each with specific roles and uses:<br><br></strong></p> <h3> <strong>Woods</strong> </h3> <p>Also known as a wood, these clubs are <strong>used for long-range shots and are used at the beginning of every hole</strong> (of course, to have the maximum distanced covered for your first shot due to their longer shafts and large, rounder heads with a flat front where the golf ball is struck).</p> <ul></ul> <p>This is called <strong>Teeing off.</strong> For longer courses, they are also <strong>used on the second swing.</strong></p> <p>These large clubs are designed to send the ball 300 yards or more with a single swing of the driver (the largest among the clubs on your bag, also known as the 1-wood).</p> <p>Wood shafts are far longer than the shafts of most other clubs. This length boosts the power that can be transferred to the ball, but it also makes it less likely that the ball will meet the quarter-sized sweet spot in the middle of the club face (yep, like other things, the greater the power, the more fiddly the control is).</p> <p>Aside from the driver, you will also have the fairway woods which are used for long fairway shots.<br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Irons </strong></h3> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/weapon-to-victory-the-golf-club-8.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">They can be recognized by the <strong>extreme angle club heads</strong> and are designed for a greater variety of shots than woods.<br><br>Irons typically have <strong>shorter shafts and smaller club heads</strong> (which is typically thin from front to back, and the club faces are grooved to impart spin on the golf ball) than woods, making them ideal for tricky situations or a much closer ball to the hole.<br><br>The shots made using irons range from 200 yards or more, in the case of 2 irons, down to 40 yards or less in the case of the various wedges.<br><br>Adept players will probably pick a "muscleback" or "blade" style of iron (blade-style features a full back on the rear of the clubhead) whereas beginners and most recreational players will opt for a "cavity back" style (the rear of the clubhead is hollowed out, which creates an effect known as "perimeter weighting", which is helpful to less-accomplished players and beginners).<br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Putters </strong></h3> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/weapon-to-victory-the-golf-club-9.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">Putters are the most specialized golf clubs in your bag, and the type of club that comes in the widest assortment of shapes and sizes. Putters are used for, as the name says, <strong>putting</strong>.<br><br>They are the <strong>clubs golfers use on the putting greens</strong> (a smooth area of short grass surrounding a hole, either as part of a golf course or as a separate area for putting), for the last strokes played on a golf hole (or sometime called the "money shot" if you catch my drift).<br><br>Putters have short (sometimes bent as a part of the design) shafts and smaller club heads with very flat, low-profile, low-loft striking faces, thus making a relatively short and low-speed strokes with the intention of rolling the ball into the hole from a short distance away. It is a highly specialized tool for a specific job, and virtually no golfer is without one.<br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Final Remarks</strong></h3> <p>Just like the Samurai that can't go to war without his Naginata (spear), Wakizashi (short sword for back-up), Bow and arrows and his trusty Nodachi (sword), or like the Roman Legionnaire can't go to conquest without his Scutum (shield), Pugio (dagger), Pilum (throwing spear), and his all-around weapon Gladius (short sword), a golfer needs an array of specific clubs for specific situations in order for him to properly play the game. One good way to start your search for your ideal <a href="https://amzn.to/2MSBt09" title="Cobra King Utility Iron GR M 3/4 Wrench, Right Hand "><strong>golf clubs</strong> </a>is thru online, websites such as <a href="https://golfgearsdirect.com.au/">golfgearsdirect.com.au</a> provides top-of-the-line golf clubs that will really suite any preference, from golf newbies to professionals.</p> <p>As for you, yes you, the reader, I hope that this article will help you pick your very own clubs that suits your preference, and for you to dominate your next game!</p>
