So, your kinda thinking "what did Tiger Woods ate to reach that height of fame?" or "Did Jack Nicklaus found Aladdin's magic lamp and wished to the genie to be an awesome golfer out of all things?".</p> <p>The answer for that, is <strong>hard work</strong>, and ton's of it.</p> <p><a href="https://golfgearsdirect.com.au/blogs/news/the-men-who-dominated-the-world-of-golf" title="The Men who dominated the World of Golf "><strong>Famous golfers</strong></a> worked their butts off to reach the peak of fame and for their names to be etched in the hall of champions and in golf history.

He also became the first golfer to card a score below his age in a PGA Tour event in 1979, shooting rounds of 67 and 66 in the Quad Cities Open at the age of 67.<br><br></p> <ul></ul> <ul> <li><span style="font-size: 15px;"><a href="https://golfgearsdirect.com.au/blogs/news/be-like-tiger" title="Be Like Tiger "><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Tiger Woods</strong></a></span></li> </ul> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Everybody knows Tiger Woods right? I mean this guy's a celebrity an one of the <strong>highest-paid athletes in the world for several years</strong>. Since he turned pro, Tiger has collected 78 PGA Tour wins, 14 majors, 10 Player of the Year awards, and the lowest career scoring average ever.<br><br></p> <ul></ul> <ul> <li><span style="color: #990000; font-size: 15px;"><strong style="font-size: 15px;">"The Golden Bear" Jack Nicklaus </strong></span></li> </ul> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3rd highest win rate just next to Tiger Woods</strong>, and also a very accomplished golf course designer, what a man!<br><br><br><br></p> <ul></ul> <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Masters</strong></h2> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/where-golf-titans-meet-3.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>Yep, as the name suggests, the <strong>Masters Tournament</strong> (or sometimes called The Masters, or U.S Masters for the people living outside North America) is one of the most distinguished championship even in the world of golf, together with the U.S Open, The Open Championship, and the PGA Championship. <br><br> The Masters Tournament is scheduled for the first full week of April and is the first major of the year. Compared to other sporting events which is <a href="https://golfgearsdirect.com.au/blogs/news/the-world-is-your-golf-course" title="The World is you Golf Course "><strong>held in different locations and venues each year</strong></a>, The <strong>Masters is held only in one location</strong>, and that is in the <strong>Augusta National Golf Club</strong>, a fruit farm turned into a private golf course by Bobby Jones back in the 1930s, in the city of Augusta, Georgia.<br><br> Bobby Jones, a noted amateur golfer and investment banker Clifford Roberts, started The Masters after Jones's grand slam in 1930. Since 1934 until today, the venue never changed and the tournament is an official money event on the PGA Tour, the European Tour, and the Japan Golf Tour. Only a handful of players are invited by the Augusta National Golf Club compared to the amount of players in other major golf events. (this "invitational event" makes the Masters more prestigious than other events too). </p> <p> </p> <h3><strong>Here are some interesting facts that will blow your mind about The Masters:</strong></h3> <p> </p> The <strong>first green jacket was awarded in 1949, to Sam Snead</strong>. (for those guys who doesn't know what a green jacket is, it is one of Bobby Jones's idea to distinguish themselves among other golf clubs, and also, it makes you look like an over-sized leprechaun, so yeah, there's that)<br> <ul></ul> The player with the <strong>most victories is Jack Nicklaus</strong> (remember, he's "The Golden Bear" that we talked earlier) who won six times in three decades: 1964, 1965, 1966, 1972, 1975, and 1986.<br> <ul></ul> The Masters has been played since 1934 with a three-year break during World War II (you know, because at that time pretty much anyone and anything should need to do something for the war effort). In 74 championships, only 35 different players have won.<br> <ul></ul> The oldest winner of the Masters was Jack Nicklaus at 46 years, 2 months, 23 days, on his 6th victory (probably that's where he gets the "golden" part of his title. This dude's a beast!).<br> <ul></ul> <p style="float: right;"><a href="https://www.active.com/golf/articles/a-history-of-the-masters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="/img/news/where-golf-titans-meet-4.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></a>The <strong>youngest winner of the Masters was Tiger Woods at 21 years, 3 months, and 14 days in 1997</strong> (and then, you know, the rest is history).<br><br>Not only was Tiger Woods the youngest player to win the Masters, but in that same year, he achieved both the lowest score ever shot at the Masters at 270, and the widest margin of victory ever seen at the Masters at 12 strokes (achievements befitting to the highest-paid player in the world of golf).<br><br>Now you see, some of the most well-known golf legends accomplished their legendary status within the field of Augusta National Golf Club. </p> <p>Anyway, moving on..</p> <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>U.S. Open</strong></h2> <p>Golf is a big thing in the US, especially <strong>among the elites,</strong> so no wonder if they too make their own tournament that includes the big leagues and the newcomers in the world of professional golf..</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/where-golf-titans-meet-5.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>U.S. Open is <strong>It is the second of the four major championships in golf,</strong> and is on the official schedule of both the PGA Tour and the European Tour. United States Open Championship, commonly known as the <strong>U.S. Open</strong>, is the annual open national championship of golf in the United States.<br><br>Since 1898 the competition has been 72 holes of stroke play (4 rounds on an 18-hole course), and the player who have the lowest total number of strokes is declared as the winner. It is organized by the United States Golf Association (USGA) in mid-June, scheduled so that, if there are no weather delays, the final round is played on the third Sunday, which is Father's Day (treating yourself with the best live game of golf on father's day is a win-win situation!). The U.S. Open is played in a variety of courses, set up in such a way that scoring is very difficult, with a premium placed on accurate driving.<br><br>The 2017 U.S. Open reached a whopping $12 million, and $2.16 million of that purse all goes to the winner of the event. The European Tour uses conversion rates at the time of the tournament to calculate the official prize money used in their Race to Dubai (which is €10,745,927 in 2017).<br><br>Just like all other golf majors, winning the U.S. Open gives a <strong>golfer several privileges and benefit</strong> that make his career much more secure if he is not already one of the <strong>elite players of the sport</strong>. U.S. Open champions are no doubt invited right to play in the other three majors (the Masters, The Open Championship (British Open), and the PGA Championship) for the next five years (talking about a place to compete with other big names in golf), as well as The Players Championship, and they are exempt from qualifying for the U.S. Open itself for 10 years.<br><br><br></p> <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Open Championship</strong></h2> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/where-golf-titans-meet-6.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>If you live in the U.K then the best golf event that you need to anticipate is the Open Championship, commonly called to as the <strong>Open or the British Open</strong> and is the <strong>oldest of the four major championships in professional golf</strong>. Held since 1860 in the United Kingdom, it is administered by The R&amp;A (Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews) and is the only major held outside the United States.</p> <p>Unlike the U.S. Open (they retained a full 18-hole playoff), U.K Open is a 72-hole stroke play tournament contested over four days (that is Thursday through Sunday). Since 1979 it has been played in the week which includes the 3rd Friday in July. At present, 156 players are in the field, mostly made up of the world's leading professionals (such as Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson), who are given exemptions, together with the <strong>winners of the top amateur championships</strong>. Other players, amateurs and professionals who are successful in a number of qualifying events are given further places in the tournament. There is a cut after 36 holes after which only the top 70 players (and ties) play in the final 36 holes on the weekend. In the event of a tie after 72 holes, a four-hole combined playoff is held; if two or more players are still tied, the winner will be determined by a sudden-death game.</p> <p><strong>British Open venues varies throughout its history and it includes the following places:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Prestwick Golf Club in Prestwick, Scotland</li> <li>Old Course at St Andrews in St Andrews, Scotland</li> <li>Musselburgh Links in Musselburgh, Scotland</li> <li>Muirfield in Gullane, Scotland</li> <li>Royal St George's Golf Club in Sandwich, England</li> <li>Royal Liverpool Golf Club in Hoylake, England</li> <li>Royal Cinque Ports Golf Club in Deal, England</li> <li>Royal Troon Golf Club in Troon, Scotland</li> <li>Royal Lytham &amp; St Annes Golf Club in Lytham St Annes, England</li> <li>Carnoustie Golf Links in Carnoustie, Scotland</li> <li>Prince's Golf Club in Sandwich, England</li> <li>Royal Portrush Golf Club in Portrush, County Antrim, Northern Ireland</li> <li>Royal Birkdale Golf Club in Southport, England</li> <li>Turnberry in South Ayrshire, Scotland</li> </ul> <p>And lastly,<br><br><br><br></p> <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The PGA Championship</strong></h2> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/where-golf-titans-meet-7.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>Last but not the least, is the PGA Championship, or also known as the <strong>U.S. PGA Championship or U.S. PGA</strong> (referred by others who live outside the United States) is a yearly golf event organized and managed by the Professional Golfers' Association of America.</p> <p>It is one and the last of the four major showdown in professional golf, and it is the golf season's major finale, played in mid-August on the third weekend prior to Labor Day weekend. It is an official money event on the PGA Tour, European Tour, and Japan Golf Tour, with a purse of $10 million since the 97th edition in 2015 (now just imagine, being a distinguished golfer means racking up millions, just like Tiger Woods did). </p> <p>Just like the British Open, the <strong>PGA Championship has been held at a large number of venues</strong> (some of the early sites are now quite obscure unfortunately), but as of later years, the event has mostly been played at a small group of distinguished courses, each of which has also held several other premiere events, including the U.S. Open and Ryder Cup.
