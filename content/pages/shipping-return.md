Order Confirmation:

As soon as you place your order, you will receive an order confirmation e-mail.  This means that we have received your order in our system and pre-authorized your credit card for the purchase.  As soon as we receive your order, we automatically reach out to our suppliers to confirm that it is in stock and available for immediate shipment.  If your item is on backorder or unavailable, we will void the pre-authorization and reach out to you via e-mail.  If your item(s) are available for immediate shipment (within 5 business days), we will process the charges and submit the order for shipment.

Order Shipment:

If your order is stock and we process the charges to your credit card, it will ship within five business days from the date of your order.  We will send you tracking information within 24 hours of your order leaving the warehouse to the e-mail address you provide when checking out.  If you do not receive tracking information from us within six business days of your order, feel free to follow up with us at **order@activefelinesolutions.com**

Damages:

Please inspect the packaging of your item(s) when they arrive, if you notice any damage you should make note of it when signing for delivery.  If your item(s) do arrive damaged, please send photos to **returns@activefelinesolutions.com** and we will process an insurance claim on your behalf.

Cancellations & Refunds:

All orders cancelled after 48 hours are subject to a $20 administration fee, whether or not your order has shipped.  If you order has shipped, you (the buyer) will also be responsible for actual return shipping charges. Refunds will only be issued to the original credit card that you use when placing your order.
